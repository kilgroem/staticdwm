staticdwm - static/dynamic window manager
============================
staticdwm is a window manager for X and a fork of dwm. It borrows the concept of
frames from ratpoison and uses dwm's tag system to select windows to fill them.


Requirements
------------
In order to build staticdwm you need the Xlib header files.


Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (staticdwm is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install staticdwm (if
necessary as root):

    make clean install

Running staticdwm
-----------------
Add the following line to your .xinitrc to start staticdwm using startx:

    exec staticdwm

In order to connect staticdwm to a specific display, make sure that
the DISPLAY environment variable is set correctly, e.g.:

    DISPLAY=foo.bar:1 exec staticdwm

(This will start staticdwm on display :1 of the host foo.bar.)

In order to display status info in the bar, you can do something
like this in your .xinitrc:

    while xsetroot -name "`date` `uptime | sed 's/.*,//'`"
    do
    	sleep 1
    done &
    exec staticdwm


Configuration
-------------
The configuration of staticdwm is done by creating a custom config.h and
(re)compiling the source code. Be sure to add a way to launch applications
applicable to your system.
